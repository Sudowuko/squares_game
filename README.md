# squares_game

Welcome to Squares Game!

There are 3 main difficulties and in each level, a certain number of squares will turn blue. The objective is to memorize which squares changed colour.

Each time, you guess them correctly, you level up making it slightly more difficult. 

If you guess the square incorrectly, you lose a life and if you lose 3 lives its game over.

To win the game, you have to reach the highest level possible.
